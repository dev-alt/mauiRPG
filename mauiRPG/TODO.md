Based on the provided codebase, here are some suggestions for what to implement or fix next:
1. Implement the combat system:
The CombatViewModel is already set up, but it needs to be connected to the CombatView and the actual combat logic needs to be implemented. You should:
a. Complete the AttackCommand, DefendCommand, and RunCommand methods in the CombatViewModel.
b. Implement the turn-based combat logic in the CombatService.
c. Update the CombatView to display combat results and enemy information.
Enhance the inventory system:
The InventoryViewModel and InventoryView are in place, but they need more functionality:
a. Implement the UseItemCommand and DropItemCommand in the InventoryViewModel.
b. Add item effects (e.g., healing potions, stat boosts) in the Item class.
c. Update the InventoryView to show item details and effects.
Implement character progression:
The LevelUpService is mentioned in the MauiProgram.cs, but it's not implemented yet. You should:
a. Create the LevelUpService class with methods to handle experience gain and level-up logic.
b. Update the Player class to include experience points and level-up thresholds.
c. Implement a level-up UI in the PlayerInfoView or create a new view for level-ups.
Enhance the game state management:
The GameStateService is used throughout the app, but it could be improved:
a. Implement save/load functionality for the game state.
b. Add methods to track quest progress and game completion.
c. Implement a system to unlock new levels or areas as the player progresses.
Improve the UI and navigation:
Some views and navigation could be enhanced:
a. Implement a more robust navigation service to handle transitions between different game screens.
b. Add animations for transitions between views and during combat.
c. Enhance the MainMenuView with more options and a better layout.
Implement enemy AI:
The EnemyController is set up, but the enemy behavior needs to be implemented:
a. Create different enemy types with unique behaviors and stats.
b. Implement basic AI for enemy actions during combat.
c. Add a system for scaling enemy difficulty based on player level or game progress.
Add more content:
To make the game more engaging, you should add more content:
a. Create more levels with unique backgrounds and enemies.
b. Implement a quest system with multiple objectives and rewards.
c. Add more items, weapons, and equipment for the player to collect and use.
These suggestions should give you a good starting point for further development of your MAUI RPG game. Remember to test each feature thoroughly as you implement it to ensure a smooth gaming experience.
